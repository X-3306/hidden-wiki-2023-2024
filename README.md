To access the dark web, download the Tor Browser. It's a secure browser that can be used on Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Android, and iOS devices. Alternatively, you can use the Brave Browser which is available for desktop and mobile devices.

Using Tor is legal in most countries, but it's important to note that certain activities, such as buying or selling drugs or weapons, are illegal.

Tor is an open-source software that hides your location and protects you against surveillance or traffic analysis. It uses almost a million relays to bounce your internet traffic around the world.

The dark web is a section of the internet that can only be accessed with specific software, such as Tor. It includes illegal marketplaces and shops, as well as secure communication channels for activists, journalists, and human rights activists.

Hidden services are websites that can only be accessed through the Tor network and have a .onion domain. You can find these websites on Tor link lists, wikis, and catalogs.

Before accessing any dark web site, make sure that it's legal in your country to browse its content.
